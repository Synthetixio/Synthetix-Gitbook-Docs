# Governance Framework

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Governance Framework.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Synthetix Protocol has several governing bodies and artifacts which co-exist to enable the decentralized nature of the protocol. The key decentralized councils and DAOs are the - Spartan Council, Treasury Council, Ambassador Council, and Grants Council. All of the councils are elected by Synthetix Stakers.

The governance process utilizes key artifacts - Synthetix Improvement Proposals (SIPs) and the Synthetix Configuration Change Proposals (SCCPs), which effectively outline proposed changes to the Synthetix Protocol. These changes are implemented by Synthetix Core Contributors, managed by the Core Contributor Committee.
