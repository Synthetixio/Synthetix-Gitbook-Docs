# Grants Council

### What is the Grants Council?

The Grants Council is responsible for public goods funding through grants, initiative bounties, or competition prizes. It is a value-based entity, whose ultimate goal in funding projects is to produce publicly accessible, beneficial, high-quality work where profit margins are not the priority. Projects are chosen not based on the value they can extract but instead on the value they can add to the community.

### Election, members

**Election Process:**

Synthetix Stakers are assigned a percentage of debt ownership in proportion to their amount of SNX staked, and their voting power is quadratically weighted. Voting is done through the fully on-chain Synthetix Governance Module.
