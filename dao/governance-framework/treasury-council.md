# Treasury Council

### What is the Treasury Council?

The primary mandate of the Treasury Council is to provide resources for the growth and expansion of the protocol. This includes managing the treasury in a way that allows continuity of funding for protocol costs (on-chain/off-chain), council and Core Contributor Stipends, ecosystem incentives, including Grants Council funding, and other discretionary incentives. The members of the council manage the treasury through a gnosis-safe multi-sig.
