# Synthetix Configuration Change Proposal (SCCPs)

The SCCP is an artifact which follows the same authoring and review process as the SIP, except the contents of the SCCP contain proposed changes to existing parameters of the system. As a result of this, SCCPs commonly reference a SIP that is deployed on the Synthetix Protocol.

SCCPâ€™s live on the same site as the SIPs [official site](https://sips.synthetix.io/) but follow a slightly different specification.
