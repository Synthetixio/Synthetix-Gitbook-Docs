# Steps for Unstaking SNX (via Burning)

#### Steps for Partially Unstaking SNX (via Burning a Portion of Debt)

1. **Visit the Staking Site**: Go to [staking.synthetix.eth.limo](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/).
2. **Access the Staking Menu**: Navigate to the staking menu and select the 'Maintain Collateralization Ratio' option.
3. **Burn a Portion of Your Debt**: This action will direct you to the staking burn menu where you can choose how much sUSD debt to burn. This process will partially unstake your SNX. This may be necessary to enable claiming, as you'll need to be at the target to claim SNX rewards.
