# Steps for Unstaking SNX

**Basic Steps for Unstaking SNX on Optimistic Ethereum**

* Visit [staking.synthetix.eth.limo](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/).
* Navigate to the [staking menu](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/). Once there, use the 'Maintain Collateralization Ratio' function, which will redirect you to the [staking burn menu](https://staking.synthetix.io/staking/burn).
* To unstake all of your staked SNX, you'll have to burn ALL of your active debt. Ensure you have enough sUSD in your wallet at the time of the transaction, and then hit "Burn Max."
* Note: You will be unable to unstake SNX that is currently in escrow, for more information on future escrow unlocks visit [escrow and vesting](https://docs.synthetix.io/staking/staking-guide/escrow-and-vesting).
