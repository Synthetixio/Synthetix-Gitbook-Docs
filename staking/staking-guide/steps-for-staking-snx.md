# Steps for Staking SNX

Basic Steps for Staking on Optimistic Ethereum

1. Transfer SNX to a compatible wallet: MetaMask, Trezor, Ledger, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Rainbow Wallet, or other Wallet Connect-supported wallets.
2. Visit [staking.synthetix.eth.limo](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/).
3. Bridge your SNX from Layer 1 (Ethereum Mainnet) to Layer 2 (Optimistic Ethereum). The bridge to process this is accessible at [https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/bridge](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/bridge).
4. You'll need to bridge over Ethereum, for gas fees, through the [Optimism Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io/) to process transactions on Optimism, just like you would on Layer 1.
5. Before proceeding, ensure that you're connected to the Optimism network by heading over to [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/). Once on Chainlist, add Optimistic Ethereum to your wallet.
6. After migrating your Synthetix and bridging over ETH to pay Optimistic Ethereum transaction fees, you can stake your tokens. To do this, navigate to the [staking menu](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/). Once there, use the 'Stake and Borrow More' function and confirm your transaction.

4. Stake your SNX using the "Stake & Borrow More" button on the [Synthetix Staking app](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/). All of your SNX is now staked and earning rewards. Your account has also been issued sUSD debt that will fluctuate in value. To hedge this debt, use the [one click debt hedging tool provided by dHedge](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/debt/manage/buy).
