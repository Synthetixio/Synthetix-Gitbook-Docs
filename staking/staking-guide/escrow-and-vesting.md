# Escrow and Vesting

### SNX Escrow and Vesting - Quick Summary

* All SNX rewards are subject to a 12-month escrow time-lock.
* Escrowed SNX is automatically staked and will continue to earn staking rewards.
* After a 12-month lock, SNX can be vested.

### Escrow and Vesting - A Deeper Explanation

**Escrow** refers to the time delay put on SNX rewards. The current time delay is one year. Escrowed SNX can still be staked and will earn staking rewards. In effect, SNX rewards can be compounded immediately to earn more rewards before the escrow is vested.

After the 52-week escrow period, stakers can vest their SNX rewards.
