# Debt Hedging Strategies

### One-Click Debt Hedging - dHEDGE dSNX <a href="#one-click-debt-hedgingdhedge-dsnx" id="one-click-debt-hedgingdhedge-dsnx"></a>

Synthetix has partnered with dHEDGE to deploy a one-click debt mirror index for SNX stakers on Optimism. With this tool, each staker can hedge their exposure to the debt pool in a few clicks.

All a staker must do is navigate to the [**Synthetix Staking dapp debt section**](https://staking.synthetix.io/debt) and purchase the dSNX token through the UI by clicking "Hedge on Toros"

1 sUSD worth of debt mirror token will hedge one sUSD worth of debt.

Example: If you have 100,000 of sUSD active debt and purchase 100,000 of the dHEDGE debt mirror index token, it will keep your debt in _approximate_ parity with the debt pool without any outside interaction.

To withdraw, a user must navigate to [Toros Finance](https://toros.finance/derivative/dsnx) and click the 'Sell' button.

**Alternate Hedging Strategies**

This is not the only debt hedging strategies, though it is the safest in ensuring that your issued debt will equal active debt when you want to exit the system.
