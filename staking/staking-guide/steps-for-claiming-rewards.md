# Steps for Claiming Rewards

### Informational Guide

* You will only receive rewards if you are staked before the weekly snapshot (Wednesday).
* To receive maximum rewards, ensure you are close to the target c-ratio. You can do this by minting max on the [staking menu](https://staking.synthetix.io/staking).
* Claimed SNX rewards are escrowed for one year. You won't be able to transfer or sell them during this time, though they will be automatically staked.
* sUSD fees are [burned weekly](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-schedar-release-fee-burn/) and do not need to be claimed; they will reduce your debt each week.

3. Unable to claim? That means your C-Ratio is below the target ratio. You can raise your C-Ratio by burning sUSD or staking more SNX. - [https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/staking/burn](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/staking/burn)
