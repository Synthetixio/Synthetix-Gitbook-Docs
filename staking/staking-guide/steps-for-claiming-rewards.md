# Steps for Claiming Rewards

#### General Information

* **Weekly Snapshot**: To be eligible for rewards, you must be staked before the weekly snapshot, which occurs every Wednesday.
* **Target c-ratio**: For maximum rewards, maintain a c-ratio close to the target. You can adjust this by minting max in the [staking menu](https://staking.synthetix.io/staking).
* **sUSD Fees**: These fees are [burned weekly](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-schedar-release-fee-burn/) and automatically reduce your debt, so there's no need to claim them manually.

**Troubleshooting**: If you're unable to claim, it could be due to a c-ratio below the target. Increase your c-ratio by burning sUSD or staking more SNX at [https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/staking/burn](https://staking.synthetix.eth.limo/staking/burn).
