# Spot Synths

Synthetix Spot Synths are synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets, such as cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and commodities. Spot Synths allow users to gain exposure to a wide range of assets without holding the actual underlying asset.&#x20;

The most notable benefit of using synths is the composable nature of synths, unlike regular assets. For example, someone could hold a spot synth for BTC, named sBTC, and provide it as liquidity on Curve Finance to enable Atomic Swaps.
