# Synthetix Token (SNX)

The Synthetix Network token (SNX) incentivizes coordination and growth within the Synthetix Network. It has two primary functions: (a) **Staking** and (b) **Governance**.

### Staking

SNX Stakers earn weekly rewards for collateralizing the network. These rewards are paid in two ways. One is from **trading fees**, which are charged to traders. The other is **inflationary rewards**, which are newly minted SNX tokens held in escrow for a year. Escrow-locked SNX tokens can be staked during this escrow and provide further rewards to stakers.

### Inflation Rewards

With the recent (Dec 2023) passage of SIP-2043, inflation has been reduced to zero, ending inflationary rewards for staking. Learn more in the [blog post](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-end-of-synthetix-token-inflation/).

For past inflation data, see the [Synthetix Inflation Stats](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/synthquest/q/inflation-table-YVromr).

### Governance

Synthetix Stakers are assigned a percentage of debt ownership proportion to their amount of SNX staked. Then their voting weight is quadratically weighted for all but the Treasury Council. Voting is done through the fully on-chain Synthetix Governance Module.
