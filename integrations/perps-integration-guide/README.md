## Description

Synthetix Perpetual Futures (Perps) are a novel perpetual future that combine

1. skew-dependant premium/discount function to incentivize rebalancing, and increase composability for assets with a wider range of liquidity profiles,
2. funding rate velocity mechanism to create natural price discovery and smooth out funding rate trajectories, and
3. hybrid oracles that combine multiple sources, and use signed off-chain price updates to improve performance and reduce cost.

The result is a perpetual future platform that can accommodate large open interest limits, on a wide range of assets, with efficient trade execution.
